# Task 1- Multi-Class Object Detection Project

## Overview
The first part contains implementations of multi-class object detection using two approaches:
1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: A baseline model for object classification.
2. **Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN)**: An advanced model for object detection with bounding box predictions.

In the second part segmentation task is experimented with deep learning approach.
Additionally, the repository includes code and results for running inference on the trained RCNN model.
