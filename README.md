# Multi-Class Object Detection Project

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of multi-class object detection using two approaches:
1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: A baseline model for object classification.
2. **Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN)**: An advanced model for object detection with bounding box predictions.

Additionally, the repository includes code and results for running inference on the trained RCNN model.
